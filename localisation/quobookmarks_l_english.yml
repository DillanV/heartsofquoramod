 QUO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Quora, a petty Q&A site, becomes an unthinkably powerful organisation in the 2050s, but alongside the rise of Quora is rising adversity for mankind. Due to a lack of resources, a nuclear war occurs that destroys much of Western civilisation, but the CEO of Quora, Adam D'Stalino, takes matters into his own hands. D'Stalino travels back in time and takes California from the United States with the intention of conquering the world. Can humanity be saved, or will it simply fall into the mericless hands of tyranny as it was detined to from the start?"
